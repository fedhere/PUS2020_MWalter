I am taking this class because I am interested in applying data science to urban environments during my PhD, specifically with remote sensing and other image data.

I hope to learn different machine learning and other data science techniques and applications of specific datasets to urban environments. I also hope to learn theories and best practices for interpreting data in the lens of public policy. Finally, I also want to gain practice in python coding.
