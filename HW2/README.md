1 - This homework was getting experience reading in a csv, running some summary statistics in python, and manipulating a dataset using pandas. Mean, median, and standard deviation were all used to understand the distribution of the Philadelphia parks dataset. We also gained experience in plotting histograms in python.

2 - I worked by myself.

3 - I did all components of the homework.
