I wanted to remake a chart from the midterm to visualize the city health data in a way that is more simple and easy to understand. The code for the new and old plot are at the very end of the notebook.


New plot:

![New plot:](https://github.com/smwalter96/PUS2020_MWalter/blob/master/HW9/pus20_viz.jpg?raw=true)

Figure 1: Bar plot of the prevalence of health factors in US cities. Data is shown as an average with error bars representing one standard deviation.

Old plot:

![Old plot:](https://github.com/smwalter96/PUS2020_MWalter/blob/master/HW9/pus_20_box.png?raw=true)

Figure 2: Box plot of health factors in US cities.

Steps:
1. Removed plot frame
2. Removed grid
3. Removed uneeded color
4. Included error bars
5. Tightened up white space
6. Long x labels on a diagonal
7. More descriptive title
8. Box plot to bar plot
