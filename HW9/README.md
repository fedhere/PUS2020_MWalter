I wanted to remake a chart from the midterm to visualize the city health data in a way that is more simple and easy to understand. The code for the new and old plot are at the very end of the notebook.


New plot:

Old plot:

Steps:
1. Removed plot frame
2. Removed uneeded color
3. Included error bars
4. Tightened up white space
5. Long x labels on a diagonal
