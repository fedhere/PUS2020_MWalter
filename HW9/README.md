I wanted to remake a chart from the midterm to visualize the city health data in a way that is more simple and easy to understand. The code for the new and old plot are at the very end of the notebook.


New plot:

Old plot:

Steps:
1. Removed plot frame
2. Removed grid
3. Removed uneeded color
4. Included error bars
5. Tightened up white space
6. Long x labels on a diagonal
7. More descriptive title
