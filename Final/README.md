Equity and Health Effects of Urban Green Space in the United States

Author: Matthew Walter

Abstract: Urban green spaces (UGS) are areas of vegetation within city centers that have been shown to have many health benefits and be essential to public health within cities. This project will use a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to represent UGS and socioeconomic variables with a random forest regression model to understand how equitably UGS are spread across the United States. Socioeconomic variables and NDVI will also be used to predict health factors in cities such as diabetes, blood pressure, and heart disease.
