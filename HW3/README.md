1 - This homework took us through all the steps of formulating a hypothesis and statistically determining if there is a difference between two proportions. We gained experience with writing null and alternate hyptheses, cleaning and reformatting our data, calculating a z score and interpreting the results.

2 - I worked by myself.

3 - I did all components of the homework.
