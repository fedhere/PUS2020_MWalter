1 - This assignment dealt with Deep Dream, a neural network created by Google to classify animals based on crowd sourced information. Along with creating bizarre images, this exercise also gives a look into the intermediate layers of a neural network. Understanding a neural network is very difficult, and by viewing these intermediate layers it helps to get a sense of how certain layers within the network are altering the image and what features they are enhancing.
